# Project to the Veil

A top-down pixel-art RPG inspired by *Stardew Valley* and *Core Keeper*.  
Currently in the **prototype stage** and under active development.  


## Overview
You awaken on a fog-shrouded island, where humanity survives within a mysterious safe zone, cut off from the outside world.  
Beyond the fog lies a forgotten land of ruins, monsters, and hidden truths.  

The game blends **farming, exploration, dungeon crawling, and survival** in a handcrafted yet procedurally generated world.


## Key Features
- **Procedural World Generation** — Perlin Noise, domain warping, chunk-based loading/unloading  
- **Core Systems** — Inventory with stacking logic, save/load system, interaction mechanics  
- **Combat** — Enemy AI with state machines, knockback, force controller, health system  
- **Environment** — Blob-based biome generation, object placement (trees, rocks, grass)  

## Roadmap
The full roadmap is managed in Notion.
